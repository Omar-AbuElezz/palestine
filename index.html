        <div class="city"><h1>Gaza City</h1><img src="img2/480px-Gaza_City.webp" alt=""></div> 
    <div class="back"><p>The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the Ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. 
        Under the Roman Empire Gaza experienced relative peace and its port flourished. In 635 CE, it became the first city in Palestine to
         be conquered by the Muslim Rashidun army and quickly developed into a center of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusaders invaded
          the country starting in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to floods and
           locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.</p>

     <div class="city-parent">
        <div class="city"><h1>Jenin</h1><img src="img2/Jenin_-_panoramio.jpg" alt=""></div> 
     <div class="back"><p>Jenin has been identified as the place "Gina" or "Ginah" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE,
         as a town in Canaan.Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning "the spring
          of gardens" or "the spring of Ganim", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to
           preserve the city's ancient name.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="city-parent">
        <div class="city"><h1>Nablus</h1><img src="img2/Nablus_2013.jpg" alt=""></div> 
      <div class="back"><p>The city traces its modern name back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian
         in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan 
         revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city.
          Following the Arab-Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus.
           After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, 
           Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered.</p>

        <div class="city"><h1>Ramallah</h1><img src="img2/480px-Il_centro_di_Ramallah.jpg" alt=""></div> 
    <div class="back"><p>Ramallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the 
        Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended 
        from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine
         after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I.The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah,
          occupied and annexed by Transjordan.</p>

     <div class="city-parent">
        <div class="city"><h1>Khan Yunis</h1><img src="img2/Khan_Yunis_panorama.jpg" alt=""></div> 
     <div class="back"><p>The Constituency of Khan Yunis had five members on the Palestinian Legislative Council. Following the 2006
         Palestinian legislative election, there were three Hamas members, including Yunis al-Astal; and two Fatah members, including 
         Mohammed Dahlan. The city is now under the Hamas administration of Gaza.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="city-parent">
        <div class="city"><h1>Jabalia</h1><img src="img2/Jabalia_41.jpg" alt=""></div> 
      <div class="back"><p>A large cemetery dating to the 8th century CE was found near Jabalia. The workmanship indicates that the Christian
         community in Gaza was still very much in existence in the early Islamic era of rule in Palestine, and capable of artistic achievements.
          The remains of the pavement spared by the iconoclasts show depictions of wild game, birds, and country scenes. The late dating of the
           mosaic pavement proves that the intervention of the iconoclasts, after 750, is later than previously thought and is associated with
            Abbasid conservatives.</p>
